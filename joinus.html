<h2>Graduate Students</h2>
<p>I'm open to hiring PhD students this application cycle (to start in fall 2024)! If you're excited about the lab's research themes, you share the team's values, and you want to build your own research program, then I encourage you to apply.</p>

<p>I'm committed to supporting my mentees as they develop their own research programs and pursue their own career goals, be they in research, teaching, industry, etc. I welcome applicants who are interested in being co-mentored (see faculty). You're very welcome to email me before you apply.</p>

<p>Applications are due on Dec 1, 2023, and fee waivers are due two weeks before that. To find out more, see the UCSB website.</p>
