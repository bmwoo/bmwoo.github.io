            <h2>What is the basis of early social evaluation?</h2>
          </div>
          <p>A large body of research suggests that infants and toddlers engage in social evaluation, preferentially reaching for and looking to agents who have helped others over agents who have hindered others in the pursuit of their goals (see <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/98d36" target="_blank">Woo et al., in press, <i>Annual Review of Developmental Psychology</i></a>). There has been intense debate about the basis of these evaluations. Are infants and toddlers evaluating agents based on whether they facilitate others' goals? Or are lower-level differences between helping and hindering actions supporting their evaluations? My research has provided evidence that infants and toddlers leverage their understanding of others' goals to evaluate social actions (<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/mtprn" target="_blank">Woo & Spelke, accepted pending minor revisions</a>). A key aim of my research is to examine how infants' and toddlers' understanding of social actions compares to that of adults.</p>

      <h2>ARE INFANTS AND TODDLERS SENSITIVE TO THE INTENTIONS UNDERLYING OTHERS' SOCIAL ACTIONS?</h2>
      <p >Are infants' and toddlers' social evaluations based on the outcomes of others' actions, the intentions driving those actions, or both? In my research, I have presented infants and/or toddlers with agents who intentionally vs. accidentally help and harm others (<a href="https://bmwoo.github.io/files/stecklerwoohamlin2017.pdf" target="_blank">Woo et al., 2017, <i>Cognition</i></a>) and with agents whose true vs. false beliefs guide their social actions (<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/eczgp" target="_blank">Woo & Spelke, in press, <i>Developmental Science</i></a>; <a href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt8k02x1mx/qt8k02x1mx.pdf" target="_blank">Woo & Spelke, 2022, <i>CogSci Proceedings</i></a>). Across my experiments, I have found that infants and toddlers privilege others' mental states in their social evaluations.</p>
      <p>My research raises the possibility that infants and toddlers more strongly represent others' mental states in strongly social contexts, such as when agents seek to act on others' goals (Woo et al., in press, <i>Trends in Cognitive Sciences</i>; <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ny5q8" target="_blank">Woo et al., 2021, <i>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</i></a>). I'm now designing ways to test this hypothesis more directly.</p>

            <h2>How do we come to understand others' mental states?</h2>
          </div>
          <p>My research has revealed that infants and toddlers have a skeletal understanding of the mental states guiding others' social actions, but how does that understanding emerge in infancy and toddlerhood? Cognitive scientists have long theorized that first-person experience acting on one's own goals leads humans to understand others' goals. Contrary to such theories, my research has revealed that 3-month-old infants, who cannot yet reach for objects effectively, can learn to attribute either object goals or spatial goals to other people (<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/dx2er/" target="_blank">Woo et al., submitted</a>; <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/qjvre" target="_blank">Woo et al., 2021, <i>CogSci Proceedings</i></a>). In ongoing research, I'm exploring the depth and breadth of these representations. In the future, I aim to examine how infants may begin applying these representations to their navigation of the social world.</p>
